Internship about Webdevelopment using html,css,javascript from Apex Software Pvt.ltd

I just completed a mini front-end project that combines key concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m excited to share it!

Here's what I built:

✅ A clean, styled Contact Form with multiple input types
✅ JavaScript Form Validation for required fields and email format
✅ A fully Responsive Layout using Flexbox for navigation and CSS Grid for content
✅ A Dynamic To-Do List using JavaScript DOM Manipulation, allowing users to add and remove tasks in real time

What I learned:

* Writing semantic and accessible HTML

* Styling with modern CSS techniques (including responsive media queries)

* Validating form data using JavaScript

* Manipulating the DOM dynamically for interactive UI components


This project helped me strengthen my front-end foundations and build real-world functionality. If you're starting out or revisiting front-end basics, I highly recommend creating something like this!
